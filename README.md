# CipherAlgorithms 🔐
CipherAlgorithms is a Java-based encryption and decryption tool that implements multiple cipher techniques, including both classical and modern encryption algorithms. The program provides a user-friendly CLI interface to encrypt and decrypt text using various methods.

### ✨ Features
Caesar Cipher – Simple shift-based encryption.
Vigenère Cipher – Keyword-based encryption.
AES Encryption (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Strong symmetric encryption.
Morse Code Cipher – Text-to-Morse and Morse-to-text conversion.
ChaCha20 Encryption – Modern, fast, and secure stream cipher.

### 🔧 How It Works
The program allows users to:

* Select an encryption or decryption operation.
* Choose from the available cipher methods.
* Input the required text and necessary keys/parameters.
* Get the encrypted or decrypted output.
